## Add Text to your Stage
The new Text-Tile lets you add small messages to your stage, simply by adding a new Tile.

### Usage
1. Select the Tile from the toolbox.

![Text-Tile in the Toolbox]( http://namespace.media/img/images/2020/04/14/Unity_8oGDlI10LZ.png "Text-Tile in the Toolbox")

2. Now Place it somewhere. You will be prompted to add your Text after that.
    (Also notice how you can enter a specific color by setting a hex-code in the bottom left box!

3. Press "Set Text" and done! You successfully created a Text in your Stage.

------------

## Default Name for Stages
Stages will now be named "Unnamed Stage" by default, so you can test them out even more easily. You can change the Name of your Stage in the Settings tab of course.

------------

## Exit confirmation in the Creator
If you want to exit the Stage Creator, you will now be asked for confirmation. This is useful to remind you to save your stage if you haven't yet.

------------

## Brush Size
The Brush Size Controls in the Stage Creator have been remapped from the ``R`` & ``F`` keys to your Scrollwheel.

------------

## Tile Selection
If you're hovering over a Tile in the Creator, you can now use the Middleclick on your Mouse to select the Tile below your Cursor.

------------

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed a Bug which loaded the wrong Platform Tiles when Testing a Stage.
2. Fixed a Bug that was removing the Tile on the previous Player Start/Flag position when changing it.

------------

## Performance Hint
1. You can now improve the Loading Performance of your Stage by placing a Checkpoint right at the Start. This is extremely useful on Stages with a lot of Tiles.
