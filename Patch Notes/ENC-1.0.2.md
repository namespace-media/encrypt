## Brush Size
The Brush Size Controls in the Stage Creator have been changed from R & F to the Up & Down Scroll of your Mousewheel

------------

## Tile Selection
If you're hovering over a Tile in the Creator, you can now use the Middleclick on your Mouse to select the Tile below your Cursor.

------------

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed a Bug which loaded the wrong Platform Tiles when Testing a Stage
2. Fixed a Bug which was removing the Tile underneath the Start Flag when changing their position

------------

## Performance Improvements
1. You can now improve the Loading Performance of your Stage by placing a Checkpoint right at the Start. This is extremely useful on Stages with a lot of Tiles.
