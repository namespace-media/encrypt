## Build Assist
### What is a Build Assist
The Build Assist is a special tile that allows you to create an entire room, a wall or a complete stage design with just one click.

### How do i use the Build Assist
1.  Select a Build Assist from the toolbox

2. Now you can place the tiles normally in the workspace. (Notice how the tiles connect automatically)

3. Use the transparent version and increase your brush size to quickly create a room.

4. You can only remove a Build Assist tile if you have selected a Build Assist to switch to the correct layer.

### Limitations and Advantages of a Build Assist
Unlike regular general tiles, you can get to your target much faster with the Build Assist if your target is a wall, floor, or room.
If you want to use the tiles to make more complex artistic decisions, you will unfortunately have to resort to the traditional tiles.

However, if you want to use the tiles within the build assist, it's easy. Just place your build assist and the normal tiles on top. This is possible because Build Assists are stored on a separate layer.

You can also use Build Assist to regain the old black background that was common before the beta.
However, if you do so, you will not be able to use any other build assist in the same space, as there can only be one build assist per tile space.

## Selected Range Indicator
### What is a Selected Range Indicator?
The Selected Range Indicator is what its name says. It now reliably shows you how much you have selected and what is affected when you delete tiles.

### How does the Indicator work
The SRI is automatically activated, and now always shows you your range when you change your brush size with `R` and `F`
