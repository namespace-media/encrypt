## Redesigned Toolbox
We redesigned the Toolbox to be more compact and easier to use!

You might wonder: "Where are all the Tiles?".. You can find the Answer right [here](#rotatable-tiles).

## Gravity Switch
We added a Gravity Switch to give Stage Creators even more ways to create awesome stages!

### How do i use the Gravity Switch

1. Select the Gravity Switch from the toolbox

2. Now you can place the tiles normally in the workspace.

3. Gravity Switch tiles can only be removec if you selected a one of the Utilities (Player Startpoints/Flags, Checkpoints or Gravity Switch).

## Rotatable tiles
We added the functionality to rotate some Tiles just by pressing the `R` key. So you dont have to search through the Toolbox for every other tile anymore.

## Stage Statistics
The Stage now stores the time it took the creator to complete it, as well as the deaths and checkpoints used.

## Improved Booster
Well.. we improved the booster alot.. They actually boost you now. Even when you exit the Boosting Area.

_wich is really nice_

## Is a Stage editable?
You can close your stage now. So you can decide if other users can edit your stage or not. If not, you are the only one who can.

You will find the toggle in the "Settings" tab.

## Toolbox hotkeys
You can now change the tabs of the toolbox by pressing the keys ``1-4``.

## "Restart" and "Back To Creator" added after finishing
We have added "Restart" and "Back To Creator" buttons to the final screen you see when you have completed testing a stage.

## Reduced loading times when opening "Themes" or "CustomStages"
The loading times when opening the "Themes" and "CustomStages" menus have been reduced tremendously.

------------
## Bug Fixes
#### The game now remembers the "Show Tracer" setting so that it does not have to be set again and again.
#### The "On/Off" blocks are now also reset when using a checkpoint.
#### The brush size had sometimes increased as you scrolled through the toolbox. This has been fixed.
#### The background tiles are no longer in front of the Build Assist tiles. 
#### Stage names are now stored directly in lower case to prevent any errors.
#### Stages can no longer be restarted by pressing the 'Enter' key if the Stage has already been completed.
